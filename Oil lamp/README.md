# YadhamSwara2023-OilLamp

Yadham Swara is a consert that organized by Students Union of Faculty of Computing and Technology, University of Kelaniya. This was held at faculty premises on 08th of Auguest, 2023. <br/>
As over the traditional way, we designed this digital oil lamp. Guests who will light the oil lamp, they just have to touch on a lamp on the display. We gave guests a touch display as the interface. <br/>
This was designed to portrait oriented; becuase the main LED panel display is oriented as portrait. But this can also use in landscape oriented displays, because this site used the bootstrap grid system. However it may not display the background image in the landscape orientation.
